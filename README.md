# SDF-FFT Design Generator
The SDF-FFT Generator is a highly parametrizable Single-Path-Delay-Feedback (SDF) Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) hardware accelerator.


## Prerequisites

The following software packages should be installed prior to running this project:
* [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org) or
* [mill](https://mill-build.com)
* [Verilator](http://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator)

## Setup

Proposed design generator is intended to be used inside [chipyard](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard) environment as one of the generators located inside `generators/dsp-blocks`. Anyhow, if you want to use this repository standalone then follow instructions below:

*  Clone this repository (with submodules).
*  Switch directory.
*  Compile code, generate verilog or run tests.

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/milovanovic/sdf-fft.git
cd sdf-fft
sbt test or ./mill sdf_fft.test
```
